# CPSC 120 - Lab 03

In the first two labs, you have learned most of the basic tools and commands that you will need for the rest of the semester in order to successfully build, test, and submit your code for grading. Using the terminal and being familiar with Git and GitHub are really good skills that will well you through your academic and professional career in the area of computer science.

## Goals

The goals for this lab is to review the tools and commands you learned in the first two weeks.

## Lab instructions

### Part 1

Create a folder called `part1` at the top-level of your repository. All the files you create for this part of the lab must be placed inside of the `part1` folder.

Write a program that prints out the following message:

`Hi, my name is your_name`

*Make sure to replace `your_name` with your actual name.*

The program should be called `part1.cpp` and the compiled file should be called `part1`. Make sure to execute the compiled file to verify that the program runs correctly.

Also, create a `README.md` file explaining what the program does. Use the following format:

```
# My information

* Name: Your full name
* Email: your university email

# Part 1 Program

(add explanation here of what the program does)
```

Lastly, run the following command: `ls > ls.out`. This command will store the output of the command `ls` into a new file called `ls.out`. Make sure you run this command inside of the `part1` folder.

Commit the files `part1.cpp`, `README.md`, and `ls.out`, and then push your changes to GitHub.

### Part 2

Create a folder called `part2` at the top-level of your repository. All the files you create for this part of the lab must be placed inside of the `part2` folder.

Write a program that asks the user to input two integers and then prints out the product (multiplication) of the two numbers. The program would look like this:

```
Enter the first integer: 5
Enter the second integer: 4
5 * 4 = 20
```

The program should be called `part2.cpp` and the compiled file should be called `part2`. Make sure to execute the compiled file to verify that the program runs correctly.

Also, create a `README.md` file explaining what the program does. Use the following format:

```
# My information

* Name: Your full name
* Email: your university email

# Part 2 Program

(add explanation here of what the program does)
```

Lastly, run the following command: `ls > ls.out`. This command will store the output of the command `ls` into a new file called `ls.out`. Make sure you run this command inside of the `part2` folder.

Commit the files `part2.cpp`, `README.md`, and `ls.out`, and then push your changes to GitHub.
